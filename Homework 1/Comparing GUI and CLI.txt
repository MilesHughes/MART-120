	GUIs and CLI are two types of user interface used. both are useful for different tasks.
 	GUIs or Graphical User interfaces are visual and use images and icons making them very user friendly. GUIs are used on almost all modern websites and applications and guide the user with buttons and menus which provides a better experience. the only downsides of GUI is that advanced users may find the GUI limiting and slower than using the direct option (CLI).

	CLIs or Command-Line interfaces are much more direct than GUIs but are very confusing and are not beginner friendly. CLIs are texted based and provide pretty much no graphics. the pros of CLI is the precision that an experienced user can perform tasks(example- on the GUI you may have to click through many menus and icons to get what you want and may not even find it, while the CLI could perform the same task with one or two commands). The user also has more control over the system when using the CLI and can go beyond and do more specific tasks compared to what a GUI has to offer. CLIs also do not use much computer power compared to the graphics needed for the GUIs so it could be useful for systems with low specs.
